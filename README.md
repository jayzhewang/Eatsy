Eatsy is a crowd sourced restaurant review app.

Eatsy allows you to search restaurants, review them, and help others learn about great local restaurants.

Built on Postgre/Ruby on Rails on the backend and React/Redux on the front end, Eatsy allows fluid browsing and scalable data storage/maintenance.

Future versions of Eatsy will include personalized landing pages, allow user followings, and enable user content upload.
